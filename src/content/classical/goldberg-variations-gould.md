Glenn Gould recorded the Goldberg Variations twice. The first, in 1955, announced a radical new voice in classical music. The second, in 1981, became his farewell.

## The 1955 Recording

Blazing speed. Crystalline articulation. A 22-year-old playing as if the notes were on fire. The Aria is taken briskly, almost impatiently — Gould is eager to get to the variations.

## The 1981 Recording

Everything has changed. The Aria now breathes with profound stillness. Tempos are slower, spaces wider. Gould had lived with this music for 26 years, and every note carries that weight.

## Which Is Better?

The wrong question. Listen to 1955 when you need energy and conviction. Listen to 1981 when you need wisdom and peace. Together, they form one of the most remarkable artistic documents of the 20th century.
