There is a particular kind of recording that arrives not merely as a new entry in the catalog but as a corrective—an argument, made quietly and without polemic, about how a piece of music should sound. The 2018 BR-KLASSIK release of Schubert's Symphony No. 9 in C major, "The Great," with Mariss Jansons conducting the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, is exactly that kind of recording. It arrived to critical acclaim, collected five-star ratings from the BBC Music Magazine and the Sunday Telegraph, and earned the admiring phrase "uncommonly fresh" from the seasoned ears at MusicWeb International. But what the reviews collectively suggested, without always saying it plainly, was that Jansons had done something genuinely difficult: he had made one of the most familiar symphonies in the repertoire sound necessary again.

To understand why that matters, it helps to know something of the symphony's strange history—a story almost too romantic to be believed. Schubert composed the bulk of the work between 1825 and 1826, during and after the longest journey of his short life. Traveling through the Austrian Alps to Bad Gastein, he encountered landscapes he described as "truly heavenly," and the symphony carries that altitude in its bones—its vastness of scale, its pastoral lyricism turning suddenly monumental. He was twenty-nine when he finished it, precisely the age at which Beethoven, his idol and impossible benchmark, had just published his *first* symphony. The ambition embedded in that coincidence is almost unbearable. Schubert never heard a public performance of the piece. After an informal reading by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in 1826 it was shelved as too long and too difficult, and it remained largely unheard until Robert Schumann, rummaging through a pile of manuscripts at Schubert's brother Ferdinand's apartment in Vienna, stumbled upon the score in the winter of 1838–39. He immediately arranged for Felix Mendelssohn to conduct its premiere at the Leipzig Gewandhaus on March 21, 1839—eleven years after Schubert's death. Schumann's subsequent review coined the phrase "heavenly length" to describe the symphony's expansive, unhurried logic, and the phrase has stuck ever since, sometimes wielded as a compliment, sometimes as a gentle warning to the impatient.

The question every conductor must answer is: how do you justify that length? How do you persuade a modern audience that Schubert's repetitions are accumulative rather than merely circular, that the coda of the finale's 180-bar peroration is revelation rather than exhaustion? Jansons' answer, captured live on February 1 and 2, 2018, at Munich's Herkulessaal, was fundamentally rhythmic. He understood, as Toscanini had intuited decades earlier and as modern score study has since confirmed, that the symphony's opening Andante is marked *alla breve*—in cut time, not the slow 4/4 processional that became standard for much of the twentieth century. This single interpretive choice ramifies through everything that follows. The introduction feels lithe, purposeful; it leads somewhere rather than merely preceding something. As the movement gathers into its main Allegro, Jansons increases the tempo by stages, creating a structural integration so seamless you barely notice the join. The famous horn triplets bounce rather than lumber. The dotted rhythms in the outer movements acquire fanfare-like incisiveness. Even at the finale's most colossal moments, the orchestra never sounds as though it is straining under the weight of the music—it sounds like it is riding it.

The BRSO, which Jansons had led since 2003, responds throughout with a quality of ensemble listening that is only possible after sixteen years of collaboration. The woodwind solos in the slow movement—that walking, searching Andante con moto in A minor—emerge with the individuality of chamber music while remaining perfectly integrated into the orchestral texture. The trombones, which Schubert unusually deployed in every movement of this symphony, are present without being overbearing, a balance the Herkulessaal's "special acoustics" help to ensure. The hall is known for its clarity, and the BR-KLASSIK engineers have captured a sound that is warm and immediate without sacrificing transparency. You can hear, when you listen closely, exactly what Schubert asks of each instrument and exactly how Jansons asks it to be given.

What distinguishes this reading from the available competition—and there is formidable competition, from Karl Böhm's warmly Romantic Berliner Philharmoniker accounts of the 1960s and '70s to Nikolaus Harnoncourt's forensically alert live recording from the mid-2000s—is precisely this quality of double fidelity. Jansons is faithful both to the letter of the score (the alla breve tempo, the harmonic enrichments of the part-writing, the fleeting quotation of the "Ode to Joy" theme in the development of the finale) and to the spirit of what Schubert was attempting: a symphony that would stand alongside Beethoven's Ninth not by imitating it but by answering it, by extending the symphonic argument in a direction that would only become fully legible to listeners who could hear forward to Bruckner and Mahler. Jansons hears the work from both ends of history simultaneously, and that double hearing is what gives the performance its peculiar authority.

There is one more thing worth saying, and it requires stepping outside the purely musical frame. Mariss Jansons died in December 2019, just sixteen months after this recording was released. He was seventy-six, and he had been conducting, in his final years, with an intensity that people who worked with him describe as extraordinary, as if he understood something about the time remaining. This Schubert Ninth was among the last recordings he made with the BRSO, alongside a Mahler Ninth and a final concert at Carnegie Hall. Heard in that light, the performance takes on a weight that has nothing to do with heavenly length. It is a document of a musician who had spent decades learning how to listen to a great work, and who, when the moment came, had nothing left to prove and everything left to give. That is, in the end, the rarest kind of recording. Not perfect—no live performance is—but true, and irreplaceable.

有些唱片，拿到手里的瞬间就知道不一样。不是因为封面设计，也不是因为乐团的名字，而是摁下播放键之后的头几秒钟——某种笃定的、几乎是呼吸般的从容——告诉你：这个人知道他在说什么。

2018年8月，BR-KLASSIK 发行了马里斯·扬颂斯与巴伐利亚广播交响乐团合作的舒伯特《第九交响曲》（C 大调，D.944，"伟大"）现场录音。录音时间是当年2月初，地点在慕尼黑赫拉克勒斯大厅。消息一出，《BBC 音乐杂志》给出五星"管弦乐首选"，《星期日电讯报》同样五星，Gramophone 年度大奖特刊将其列为强烈推荐，措辞是"有机的流动感"——这种高度一致的叫好，在评论界并不常见。

要真正进入这张唱片，得先理解这部交响曲本身所携带的历史重量。

舒伯特写这首曲子，大约在1825年到1826年之间。那一年夏天，他做了一生中最长的一次旅行：从维也纳出发，经林茨、萨尔茨堡，一路走到阿尔卑斯山麓的巴德加施泰因。他在信里描述沿途的景色——"真正是天国般的"——这个形容后来几乎成了这部交响曲本身的注脚。那种辽阔，那种牧歌气质与宏伟规模之间奇特的张力，都嵌在音符里。

写这部交响曲时，舒伯特二十九岁，而贝多芬在同样年纪刚刚发表了他的第一部交响曲。这个时间上的错位，本身就是一种无言的宣言：舒伯特要写一部"大交响曲"，配得上他心目中的那个偶像。然而他从未听到这部作品的公开演出。1826年，学友协会曾做过一次内部读谱，结论是"太长、太难"——就这样搁置了。舒伯特在1828年11月去世，留下这部手稿睡在他兄弟费迪南德的公寓里。

十年后，罗伯特·舒曼到维也纳探访费迪南德，在一摞文件里翻出了这份乐谱，立刻意识到自己看到的是什么。他托门德尔松在莱比锡布商大厦指挥了首演，时间是1839年3月21日。舒曼的乐评里出现了那句后来被反复引用的话：「天国般的长度」。这个描述既是赞美，也是警告——它承认了这部交响曲在时间上的野心，也预示了演绎者必须面对的挑战：怎样让这种长度变得合理，而不是令人疲倦。

扬颂斯的回答，是从速度开始的。

这部交响曲的第一乐章以一段引子开头，由独奏圆号吹出那个著名的主题。长期以来的演奏传统，是把这段引子处理成缓慢、庄重的4/4步伐。但查阅手稿可以发现，舒伯特标记的是"alla breve"——即切分拍，意味着音乐的基本律动应该更为轻盈、有弹性。扬颂斯采纳了这一学术发现，把引子处理成一种从容但有内在推动力的行进，而不是沉重的宣告。然后，他以渐进加速的方式将引子与主体 Allegro 无缝焊接在一起——这个过渡在唱片里几乎听不到缝隙，你只是感觉音乐开始呼吸了。

这种对节奏的重视，贯穿全曲。第一乐章里圆号的三连音跳跃而不是沉重地落下；终乐章大提琴与低音提琴的律动像弹簧一样；铜管和定音鼓的清晰度——赫拉克勒斯大厅的声学功不可没——让人隐约听见勃拉姆斯之后的勃鲁克纳，听见这部作品在历史坐标上的位置。慢乐章里的木管独奏，又带着室内乐般的细腻，几乎每一句都是一次小小的歌唱。整部交响曲长达六十分钟，却没有一处让人觉得冗余——舒曼所说的"天国般的长度"，在这个版本里被证明是一种充实，而非拖沓。

扬颂斯与巴伐利亚广播交响乐团合作了整整十六年，这场录音发生在合作的第十五年。那种信任感，是无法伪造的。乐团在他的棒下不是在完成指令，而是在进行一场共同的思考。

在可供参考的版本中，这张唱片找到了一种难得的中间地带。卡尔·伯姆与柏林爱乐的老录音温暖、浑厚，是传统德奥风格的典范；哈农库特的历史知情演奏则充满分析性的棱角。扬颂斯既不走纯粹的浪漫主义路线，也不执着于历史考据的疏离感，而是用现代大乐团的编制，却呈现出接近室内乐的透明度与弹性——这恰好契合了舒伯特作品本身的双重身份：形式上属于古典，精神上指向浪漫。

还有一件事，不得不说。

2019年12月，扬颂斯去世，享年七十六岁。这张舒伯特第九，是他生命最后阶段留下的录音之一，与马勒第九和他在卡内基音乐厅的最后一场音乐会同属一个时期。回头听这张唱片，会隐约感到某种特别的专注——不是刻意为之的告别感，而是一个彻底厌倦了保留的音乐家，把他所知道的关于这部音乐的一切，都放进了这六十分钟。

舒伯特二十九岁写完这部交响曲，带着"我能与贝多芬比肩"的雄心；扬颂斯七十五岁录下它，带着十六年合作积攒的笃定。两种从容之间，隔着将近两百年，却在那个2月的慕尼黑夜晚奇迹般地重叠了。
