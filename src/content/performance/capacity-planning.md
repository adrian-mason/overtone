Capacity planning is the discipline of predicting future resource needs based on current trends. Done well, it prevents outages. Done poorly, it wastes money or causes fires.

## The Basic Formula

Measure current utilization, project growth rate, identify the ceiling. The gap between projected demand and capacity is your planning horizon.

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming linear growth (it's usually exponential)
- Ignoring seasonal patterns
- Planning for average load instead of peak
