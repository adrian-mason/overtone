The platinum trophy notification dropped at around 2 AM on a Tuesday. I put the controller down, sat with the ending credits still scrolling, and felt something I rarely feel after finishing a game: not satisfied, exactly, but properly moved. Tales of Berseria had taken 80 hours and two full playthroughs to get here, through colosseum grinding and inventory management I will not romanticise, and I was genuinely, stubbornly glad I'd done all of it.

Tomorrow, Tales of Berseria Remastered launches for PS5. If you're a lapsed Tales fan who skipped this one, or a JRPG player who's heard the name and never pulled the trigger, this is the push you needed.

## The thing about Velvet

I played Tales of Zestiria first. Bounced off the combat around hour 15 and never looked back. Berseria sat in my backlog for years as a result — if the series had already failed me once, why give it another shot?

The first hour of Berseria dismantled that logic entirely.

Velvet Crowe is not a hero. The game is not subtle about this. Within the opening sequences, you understand exactly what drives her: a rage so total it has become almost serene. Artorius, her brother-in-law, sacrifices her younger brother in a ritual. The trauma transforms Velvet into a Daemon, a creature that devours other monsters. She calls herself the Lord of Calamity. She means every word.

Here's what makes this setup actually work: the game never flinches, and it doesn't ask you to either. Artorius and his order, the Abbey, are genuinely trying to save the world. Daemonblight — a disease born from humanity's negative emotions that transforms people into monsters — is a real catastrophe, and the Abbey are the only thing standing between it and civilisation. Their solution, erasing all emotion from humankind, is monstrous. But their diagnosis is correct. The public reveres them as saviors. They're not wrong that Velvet's rage is part of the problem.

Every JRPG has righteous heroes fighting cartoonish evil. Berseria makes you fight for the rage. For the messy, destructive, very human refusal to accept that grief should be surgically removed.

This inversion only lands if Velvet herself is compelling to spend time with. She is. She's furious and occasionally funny and tender in ways that sneak up on you — tenderness she would probably refuse to acknowledge. The party she assembles around her works because of how it orbits her gravity: a Malak boy she claims to treat as a weapon, a witch with a private agenda, a pirate who wants to plunder heaven itself. None of them are heroes. They all have reasons. The game earns their company slowly, and then, about two-thirds of the way through, it starts spending that credit.

## The combat has a secret

I'll be honest: when I first loaded Berseria after Zestiria, the combat looked like more of the same. Buttons mapped to Artes, resource gauge to manage, free 3D movement around the arena. Standard Tales fare, I assumed.

The Soul Gauge is not standard fare. It took me maybe twenty hours to understand why.

In most action RPGs, resources regenerate passively — you wait, then attack more. Berseria's Soul Gauge depletes each time you use an Arte, and attacking with an empty gauge lets enemies deflect your hits cleanly. You can steal Souls from enemies mid-fight to refill. They can steal them back. The Gauge isn't a meter so much as a second battlefield running alongside the visible one.

Once the Break Soul clicked for me — when your gauge is full enough, you can blow it open, Velvet's arm goes bestial, and normal combo limits stop applying — the whole system transformed. It stops being button-mashing. Or rather: it *is* button-mashing if you refuse to engage with it, and it reveals actual depth over 60 hours in ways that feel discovered rather than tutorialised. The Colosseum fights in the game's second half pushed me to finally understand what each party member's Break Soul does, and why swapping active characters mid-fight via Switch Blast can change a losing encounter into a controlled one.

The Malak Artes layer — where your party's elemental abilities come from Malak companions and can be chained into your combos — I was still finding new angles on at hour 50. There's something genuinely satisfying about a system that holds things back for that long. The tutorials, per virtually every Steam reviewer and my own first three hours, are spectacularly long. Push through them. The system they're teaching is worth the patience.

## The gut-punches

I'm going to stay deliberately vague here, because Berseria's best moments work as ambushes and I'd rather not defuse them for you.

What I'll say: the game has at least three moments that hit me in ways I wasn't braced for. One involves a party member I'd started taking for granted. One is a conversation that retroactively reframes everything that came before it. One is the ending — which I won't describe beyond saying that it earns its conclusion the way the best fiction does, connecting back to the opening with a clarity that rewards 80 hours of investment.

Reviewers praised the "emotional storytelling." That framing is accurate but insufficient. What the game actually does is spend 60 hours making you care about people who are, by their own admission, monsters and outcasts — and then it shows you what that caring costs. Velvet's arc doesn't end where you expect it to. The shape of it surprised me completely.

## The platinum grind, honestly

I'm not going to pretend the platinum was uniformly enjoyable. It wasn't.

The satisfying trophies: the Colosseum difficulty tiers, the grade-based battle challenges that force you to understand the combat system rather than brute-force it, and the personal subquests tied to individual characters. These feel like things the game wanted you to find anyway. Chasing them felt like playing the game well, not working around it.

The trophies I will not romanticise: the item collection requirements. Berseria's loot system functions like a stripped-down looter-shooter — you accumulate generic equipment constantly and manually disenchant duplicates in bulk. A Steam reviewer described this as playing "account manager," which is exactly right. Do it in small doses or it will hollow you out.

The second playthrough at higher difficulty is unavoidable for certain trophy conditions. I didn't actually mind this — Grade, the currency earned from battles and carried forward into New Game+, makes the second run faster, and playing with full mechanical fluency is its own satisfaction. But going in, you should know that 80 hours is a realistic estimate, not a pessimistic one.

Was it worth it? Yes. Not because every hour was fun, but because one trophy flag in New Game+ unlocks the version of the ending that completes the story properly. The platinum grind is the toll the game extracts for its truest conclusion. I think that's appropriate, given what the story is about.

## The recognition problem

Tales of Berseria holds a Metacritic score of 79/100 on PS4 and 80/100 on PC. "Generally favorable." On Steam, 91% of 6,261 reviews are positive. It sold reasonably. It is not, in most genre conversations, treated as a landmark.

I think this is a mistake.

The criticisms that docked points were mostly warranted. The dungeon environments are generic in ways that would have looked dated in 2017, let alone 2026. Backtracking through old areas is genuinely mandatory in ways that make traversal a chore. The world design doesn't match the quality of anything else in the game. These are design problems, not texture problems, and the remaster won't fix them.

A game can have real flaws and real ambition simultaneously. Berseria took a franchise formula that was becoming comfortably predictable and broke it deliberately — gave the villain the protagonist slot, assembled a party of other villains around her, and then spent 60 hours asking whether "villain" and "wrong" mean the same thing. The answer it arrives at is honest and unresolved in the way that good fiction usually is.

The remaster is a genuine opportunity for the game to find the audience it deserved in 2017. If you played Zestiria and bounced off the Shepherd's relentless optimism — I understand, I did too — Berseria is not that. If you've played other JRPGs and found the genre's relationship with darkness a bit aestheticized and consequence-free, this is worth your time. If you've already played it and skipped the platinum: the true ending earns the account manager sessions.

The trophy notification at 2 AM felt like something. That's rarer than it should be.

明天 Tales of Berseria Remastered 就上线了。

我昨天刚拿到白金奖杯。

80 小时，两周，两周目，加上数不清的竞技场失败局——值得。

Remaster 的时机让我重新想起这款 2016 年的游戏，它为什么当年没有得到它应该有的关注，以及它现在为什么值得你认真考虑一次。

## 我怎么进来的

我是带着偏见开始 Berseria 的。

在这之前，我玩过 Zestiria——在第一个 boss 前卡了一个多小时，搞不清楚那套战斗系统在要求什么，最后关掉了再也没有打开。对 Tales 系列的印象因此固定下来：战斗混乱，入门门槛莫名其妙地高，不适合我这种只想推主线的人。

Berseria 在 PS5 上装完，我给自己设了一个心理底线：玩两小时，不喜欢就卸载。

第一个小时结束时，我忘记了吃饭。

开场不复杂：Velvet Crowe 的弟弟被当作祭品，凶手是她最信任的人，她只能眼睁睁看着。两年后，Velvet 已经不再是那个人了。她有一个目标，只有一个目标。

游戏没有问你喜不喜欢她。它把控制权交给你，让你操控她。

那是我在 JRPG 里很久没有体验到的开场方式：不请求你的同情，直接让你成为那个人。

## 坏人视角

Berseria 最根本的设计选择是：主角不是英雄。

Velvet 在游戏世界里的官方头衔是「灾厄之王」(Lord of Calamity)，她接受这个称号，也配得上它。她的队伍是一帮被社会驱逐的人——魔物、海盗、逃犯。她们做的事，在这个世界的眼里不是拯救，更接近破坏。

而反派 Artorius，整个世界的人都视他为圣人。他的目标是消灭 Daemonblight (恶魔病)——一种由人类负面情感引发、会让人变成魔物的瘟疫。他的解决方案是彻底的：清除全人类的情感。

游戏把这两个人放在天平两端，然后不告诉你哪边更重。

这个设置有个创作陷阱：编剧很容易把「黑化女主」写成「其实心地善良只是外表凶」的旧套路。Berseria 没有。Velvet 的愤怒是真实的，贯穿始终，游戏从不为她辩解，也不打折。正因为如此，当她的某些时刻显露出别的东西时，才会有分量。

这是我在 JRPG 里少见的体验：跟着一个我不完全认同的角色走，同时完全理解她为什么这样做。

## 战斗：第二十小时才开窍

我在头十小时里觉得战斗比 Zestiria 好一点，但依然有点乱。

系统叫做 Liberation-LMBS——可以在战场上自由移动，用 Artes 消耗 Soul Gauge，打空了攻击被弹反，要靠打敌人「偷」灵魂来维持攻势，满格可以触发 Break Soul 突破连击上限，Switch Blast 让备用角色突袭换人，Mystic Artes 是终结技，Malak Artes 是神依技能……

教程在头几个小时里一直在冒出来。我当时主要靠「记得比什么都多就按」在撑。

大概第二十小时，某场精英怪战斗结束之后，我意识到我刚才做了一套完整的循环：偷灵魂→连击→触发 Break Soul→Switch Blast 换人接续→打完换回来。是我主动决策的，不是瞎按的。

那套系统在那一刻变成了我的。

到后期把 Velvet 的 Break Soul 和队伍的 Malak Artes 搭配配好，战斗完全是另一个维度的游戏。我曾在某个地牢里站了三个小时，回过神来才发现时间。那种沉浸感是 Zestiria 里我完全没有体会到的。

这套系统最聪明的地方，是它和 Velvet 的故事主题暗合：你靠「掠夺」维持战斗力，就像 Velvet 靠别人的愤怒维持自己的复仇。主题不只在剧情里，也渗进了机制里。

## 那几个让我停下来的时刻

我尽量不剧透。但有几个点值得说。

游戏的第三章有一段没有战斗、没有阴谋的日常对话，两个角色在讲废话，轻松的那种废话。我当时笑了。

五分钟后我意识到那段对话在做什么：它在证明 Velvet 内心还有什么没有被吃干净。这让后面的某些场景的重量大幅提升。

最终章之前有一段剧情，我在玩到之前看了几条讨论帖，有玩家说看哭了，我内心觉得有点夸张——JRPG 的煽情通常太刻意，廉价的那种。

后来我玩到了。我停在那里大概五分钟，没有按任何键。

游戏没有告诉你应该感动。它只是把几个在过去 60 小时里你已经认识的角色放在一个位置上，然后闭嘴。你自己明白发生了什么。

制造廉价眼泪很容易——放一段悲伤音乐，让角色说几句感性台词，镜头推进。Berseria 的那个时刻什么都没有做，只是把事情摆在那里。这是优质情感设计和平庸情感设计最核心的区别。

## 白金的代价

80 小时。两周。两周目。

第一周目大概 45 小时，跟着主线走，顺手清了支线和收集。New Game+ 保留大部分进度，第二周目效率高很多，但有几个奖杯专门针对竞技场 (Colosseum)——需要在特定难度通关一系列关卡，对队伍配置有要求。

让我卡住最久的是竞技场某个特定关卡，连续失败了将近三小时。查了攻略，发现问题出在 Velvet 的 Break Soul 技能搭配上——我用了错误的属性组合，导致某类敌人对我的连击有抗性。调整之后，这关第一次就过了。

解决那一刻确实有点成就感，不是因为奖杯，而是因为我终于真正搞明白了这套系统在要求什么。

让我没有预料到的是：这 80 小时的后半段，我没有进入那种典型的白金磨耗状态——机械刷，盯着进度条，盼着结束。刷竞技场的间隙我还在想剧情，想几个角色的走向，想结局的某几个细节。

能做到这一点，全靠故事。

## 哪里让人皱眉

这不是一款没有缺点的游戏。

地图设计很旧。地牢是 PS3 时代的走廊风格——昏暗，重复，大量强制回头路。初见某些地牢时我以为资源没有加载完，后来发现那就是设计。游戏部分区域的视觉复杂程度，甚至不如同时期的其他 RPG。

移动速度早期也偏慢。如果你刚从开放世界游戏切换过来，会明显感觉不适应——地图要走很多遍，速度却没有补偿。

战斗里有一个细节到现在还让我皱眉：多敌人战场的锁定切换不稳定，有时候会选错目标。某些 Boss 战我干脆放弃锁定，靠手动移动来维持位置。

物品系统是标准的垃圾山。游戏塞给你大量装备，大部分是噪音，你得花时间手动分解。不是有趣的资源管理，是管理摩擦。

这些问题都是真实的，但它们没有让我放下手柄。

## 这款游戏适合你吗

如果你玩过几款 JRPG，但「主角拯救世界」的框架已经让你有点疲——Berseria 是一个好的转变。它从第一个小时就走另一条路。

如果你是从 Zestiria 来的，跟我一样曾经被挡在门外——Berseria 的战斗在头十小时同样有学习曲线，但架构更清晰，等它打开的那一刻，是值得的。

如果你在考虑买原版还是等 Remaster——Remaster 明天 (2026 年 2 月 26 日) 就上线，支持 PS5、Xbox Series X/S 和 Switch，会包含 DLC 和画质改进。现在入手，时机比过去任何时候都好。

这个故事关于愤怒，关于失去某样东西之后你会变成什么人，关于当你的目标达到时你还剩下什么。

它值得 80 小时。
