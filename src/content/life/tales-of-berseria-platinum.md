The first hour ends with Velvet in a prison, her arm mutated into something monstrous, her brother dead. Not offscreen. Not implied. You watch it happen.

I almost didn't give this game a chance. I'd played Tales of Zestiria — the game set a thousand years after Berseria in the same world — and bounced off it somewhere around hour six. The combat felt arbitrary. The protagonist was decent enough but generically heroic in the way that most JRPG leads are decent enough. I shelved it, put Berseria in the "someday" pile, and left it there for years.

What finally moved it up the queue was a throwaway comment in a forum thread: *"Zestiria is the prequel's aftermath. Berseria is where everything actually matters."* I booted it up on my PS5 — the original version, not the Remastered that drops tomorrow — and didn't put it down for eighty hours.

## The Woman They Put in a Cage

Here's what Berseria does that almost no JRPG attempts: it makes you root for someone who does genuinely terrible things.

Velvet Crowe is not a hero with a dark streak. She is not a protagonist who struggles with her violent impulses and ultimately chooses the light. She is angry, she is selfish, and she will hurt people to get what she wants — and the game never asks you to pretend otherwise. When she recruits her party of misfits, she does it through coercion, or because their goals happen to align with hers. She is, by the world's own taxonomy, a daemon. The game calls her the Lord of Calamity and means it.

The opposing force — the Abbey, the theocratic order led by the man who murdered her brother — is presented as genuinely good to most of the world. They protect people. Their leader, Artorius, is measured and compassionate and reasonable. The game spends real effort making you understand why someone would follow him. This is not a villain who twirls a mustache.

What this creates is a moral tension that most JRPGs completely avoid. Every game in the genre eventually asks you to save the world, and the saving usually resolves the moral complexity into something clean. Berseria never gives you that release valve. Velvet's goal is revenge — not justice, revenge — and the game knows the difference. It never lets you forget it.

The surprising thing is how effective this becomes as a structural choice. Because Velvet is the "wrong" protagonist — because she is angry where she should be diplomatic, selfish where she should be selfless — every moment where the game gives her a flash of warmth lands harder. You haven't been primed for it. It has to be earned. And because the game is disciplined about this, when it earns those moments, they stay with you.

## The System You Didn't Know You Were Learning

I'll be honest: the first ten hours of Berseria's combat feel like a mess.

There's a Soul Gauge that depletes when you use Artes, a Break Soul that activates when the gauge is full enough, a Blast Gauge for swapping characters mid-combo through Switch Blasts, Mystic Artes that drain the Blast Gauge, and Malak Artes tied to the spirit-type party members with their own separate activation conditions. The tutorials run too long. The explanations arrive before you need them. In early fights it's easy to mash through encounters on normal difficulty without understanding any of it.

Then, around the twenty-hour mark, the combat opens up.

Enemies start deflecting your attacks when your Soul Gauge is empty. Bosses steal your souls and flip the resource dynamic. The colosseum introduces encounters where Break Soul timing matters specifically — where Velvet's bestial arm triggers different elemental effects against different enemy types, and using it at the wrong moment wastes the gauge you needed for a Switch Blast. The depth was there from the beginning. You just hadn't been forced to find it.

This is either a design virtue or a design flaw depending on your patience for systems that don't announce themselves. I landed on virtue, but I understand the people who call it an overcomplicated mess. The game does almost nothing to tell you when you've crossed from button-mashing into actual competence. You figure it out from losing fights you should have won.

For the platinum run, that mechanical understanding becomes non-negotiable. The late colosseum tiers require genuine skill — knowing when to burn the Blast Gauge, when to play defensive and steal souls back, when to pull a reserve Malak-type party member through a Switch Blast to change the elemental pressure. Those fights were some of the most satisfying moments in the entire eighty hours.

## The Scenes That Sat With Me

I'm going to stay vague here because Berseria is a game you should arrive at without knowing where it goes.

What I'll say is this: there are three or four scenes in this game that I closed the application after and went to make coffee. Not "wow, good cutscene" moments — the kind where you need a minute before you do anything else.

The writing earns them. The game spends sixty-plus hours building specific emotional relationships — not abstract party bonds but the particular, friction-filled dynamic of people who ended up together for complicated reasons — and then uses those relationships with precision. It knows what it's been constructing. It doesn't waste the investment.

The ending is why the platinum was worth it, and I don't say that lightly after two full playthroughs and more colosseum grinding than I want to count. Whatever it costs you to get there, the accounting comes out right.

## Where It Loses Me

Berseria is not a beautiful game. The dungeon design is, without exaggeration, PS3-era quality: linear corridors with combat encounters scattered along the path and chests placed as afterthoughts. The world exists to connect story beats rather than to be explored. I stopped noticing after twenty hours, but those first twenty hours require real tolerance for environments that feel fifteen years behind the narrative quality.

The loot system is a chore. You will accumulate hundreds of pieces of generic equipment, most of it identical to things you already have, all of it requiring constant disenchanting to extract upgrade materials. I spent ten minutes after every few hours clearing inventory — not an engaging loop, just housekeeping.

The default movement speed before you unlock speed items is actively frustrating. Backtracking through locations you've already cleared, at a pace that feels designed to pad runtime, is the one part of the game I cannot defend.

None of this is subtle. The reviews that docked points for these things were right to do so. A game this strong narratively deserved environments that didn't feel like an afterthought.

## Sixty Percent Satisfying, Forty Percent Chore

That's my honest assessment of the trophy list.

The satisfying sixty: story-linked trophies that pushed me to read lore I'd been half-skipping; character-specific Artes mastery trophies that required actually learning party members I'd been neglecting; the colosseum completion that demanded real mechanical engagement. These felt like the game asking me to see everything it had built.

The chore forty: chest-opening completion requiring backtracking to every map with a checklist; cooking recipe completion requiring ingredient farming runs with no inherent interest; the new game plus pass needed to catch missable items from the first playthrough.

The second playthrough was, unexpectedly, fine. Moving faster through a story I already knew, I caught beats I'd rushed through the first time. Some scenes hit differently the second time, knowing what they were building toward. The grind I resented was the final stretch of the first run — backtracking for completion percentage, map by map, trophy by trophy, with no narrative propulsion left to carry it.

Would I do it again? Yes, without hesitation, if you told me what waits at the end of it.

## The Recognition Problem

Berseria holds a Metacritic score of 79 on PS4 and 80 on PC. That's respectable. It's also, I think, a meaningful undercount of what the game actually achieves.

The scores reflect its genuine weaknesses — dated visuals, repetitive environments, a combat system that undersells itself. What they don't capture is how rare it is for a franchise JRPG to take the kind of narrative risk this game takes, execute it consistently across sixty-plus hours, and stick the landing. The "darker Tales game" pitch sounds like a marketing angle. What Berseria delivers is a coherent argument about emotion and reason and the price of certainty, told through a character who never becomes what you expect her to become.

It deserves more than its Metacritic score, more than being known primarily as "the Zestiria prequel," and more than the reception it got at launch when players complained — not incorrectly — about the PS3-era graphics and missed what was underneath them.

The Remastered edition releases tomorrow: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC, with bundled DLC and quality-of-life improvements. If you've been sitting on this one, that's your entry point.

## Who Should Play This

If you've played a Tales game and bounced off it — particularly if you bounced off Zestiria — Berseria is different in the ways that matter. The combat starts similarly overwhelming but the underlying system has actual coherence once it reveals itself. More importantly, Velvet is a protagonist with a clear, consistent, emotionally legible motivation from hour one to the end. Sorey, by comparison, felt like someone to whom things happened.

If you've never played a Tales game, this works as a starting point, with the understanding that the series' structural DNA — long tutorials, skit-heavy exposition, inventory management that never quite feels designed — is present and unmitigated.

Eighty hours ago I had low expectations. A game I'd had on the backlog for years because the one set in its future hadn't worked for me. What I found was the angriest, most emotionally precise JRPG I've played in a decade — one where the protagonist's defining trait isn't courage or kindness but a refusal to let go of something the world keeps insisting she should release.

Every protagonist I've picked up since has felt, by comparison, like they're playing it safe. I didn't know how much I'd wanted someone to stop playing it safe until Velvet Crowe grabbed me by the collar in the first hour and held on.

白金奖杯的音效响起时，距离我第一次按下开始键已经过了将近 80 个小时。

斗技场 (colosseum) 的最后几场把我打得有点麻木，但那种麻木在音效响起的瞬间消散了。不完全是成就感——准确地说，是一种轻微的悲哀。因为接下来我要玩别的游戏了，而那些游戏的主角，很可能都不会有 Velvet Crowe 的十分之一好。

我是带着偏见来玩这游戏的。几年前打过 Tales of Zestiria，在某个 boss 上卡了一个多小时，最终直接关机放弃。感觉这系列大概就是那样：华丽的动漫皮，乱哄哄的战斗，主角喊着口号拯救世界。有人跟我说 Berseria 不一样。我半信半疑地开了机。

开场不到一小时，我知道他说得对。

## Velvet：拒绝解释自己的反派主角

传统 JRPG 里「黑暗系主角」通常是个包装——他们表面冷酷、内心善良，最终还是走向救世那条路。这套公式用了几十年，用到我已经条件反射地在等那个「软化」的节点。

Velvet Crowe 没有给我这个节点。

游戏开场就交代了她的驱动力：**复仇**，对一个特定的人。她的愤怒不是迷失，是清醒的选择。她知道自己在做什么，知道世界不会同情她，也从不要求别人理解。她的队伍聚集了「恶鬼」、「业魔」和各种被社会排斥的边缘存在，而那个被民众当成救世主的势力，才是她的对手。

这个设定有多危险，只有真正执行它才知道。一旦松动——给主角安排一个「其实是为了更多人好」的隐藏动机，或者让她在中途发现「复仇没有意义」然后升华——整个基础就崩了。Bandai Namco 的开发团队没有松动。Velvet 到最后还是 Velvet。

这是我在 JRPG 里第一次感受到：我不需要游戏提醒我为主角加油。她的愤怒本身就足够了。

经历了 Velvet 之后，再看「天命之人带着笑容拯救世界」的叙事，你会开始问：为什么？你真的在乎吗？这个问题以前从来没浮现过，现在它很难消失。

## 战斗系统：你需要耐心，但它是值得的

Berseria 的战斗在前 15 小时是有点令人迷糊的。

教程一个接一个：Soul Gauge (灵魂计量表)、Break Soul (灵魂释放)、Switch Blast (爆发换人)、Blast Gauge (爆发值)、Malak Artes (玛勒技)……每隔几小时就有新机制涌进来。我完全理解网上那些「战斗太乱」的抱怨——如果只是随手乱按，它看起来确实就是随手乱按。

但 Soul Gauge 的核心逻辑理解了之后，战斗会脱胎换骨。每个角色最多持有 5 点灵魂，用招式会消耗；耗尽时，攻击很容易被弹开，几乎打不出伤害。真正的循环是：用普攻和特定招式从敌人身上**抢夺**灵魂，维持计量表，在计量表充足时触发 Break Soul——暂时解放 combo 上限、激活角色专属的强化形态。Velvet 的 Break Soul 是她左臂异化成魔物，根据敌人属性自动切换元素攻击；其他角色各有不同，而 Malak 成员的玛勒技系统又是另一套独特的配合逻辑，和人类角色的打法节奏完全不一样。

Switch Blast 在 Boss 战里变得尤其重要。消耗爆发值换人，换进来的角色可以打一次免费追击——用得好，是控制场面节奏的核心工具，不只是花哨的演出。

一周目结束时我只是「大概会用」。二周目重玩，知道剧情走向之后反而可以专心研究战斗，才真正摸清楚节奏。这套系统不是会让你第一个小时就沉迷的那种，但如果你给它 30 小时，它会回馈你。

## 那些没有提前告知、但真实打中你的时刻

我尽量不剧透。

Berseria 有两条情感叙事线在同步推进：正式剧情演出，以及可以随时跳过的角色对话 (skits)。前者是主线，后者才是核心。

游戏里最有分量的人物关系——Velvet 和同伴之间那种说不清的相互试探、嘲讽、和逐渐形成的某种信任——几乎都藏在 skits 里。一段两分钟的行走途中对话，没有任何仪式感地弹出，说了一句你之前没意识到一直在等待的话。

我有好几次停下来，把刚结束的 skit 重新看了一遍。

这种感受不是「游戏给了我一个震撼反转」，而是「原来整件事一直在往这个方向走，我没注意到」。这是一种更难制造的情感，因为它需要 30 小时以上的铺垫才会成立。Berseria 做到了。

结局——只说这么多——让这 80 个小时的投入有了回报。不是那种「对，任务完成了」的回报，是那种让你对整个旅程的性质有了新理解的回报。

## 白金：哪些值得，哪些是折磨

大部分奖杯在正常游玩的过程中会自然解锁：推完主线、探索地图、升级角色技能树。真正需要刻意刷的集中在两个地方。

**斗技场**是最费时间的部分，需要在所有等级的赛事里夺冠，包括后期的高难度组队挑战赛。这部分的问题不是太难，是太重复——到最后你会进入「机械地重复同一个战斗循环直到奖杯弹出」的状态。有点像做完精彩的工作后还要处理文书：必要，但谈不上享受。

**素材与料理系统**比我预期的轻松很多，路上顺手收集已经可以覆盖大部分需求，不需要专程刷图。

两周目是必须的：一周目结束后开放专属内容，部分奖杯需要在二周目特定节点手动触发。整体节奏是——一周目正常体验剧情，二周目加速推进 + 补收集 + 刷斗技场——加起来大概 80 小时。

白金值不值？如果你只是想体验剧情，40 小时的一周目完全够。但二周目有一个独特的价值：知道结局之后再看某些前期场景，情感重量完全不同。这不是意外，是刻意设计进去的。

## 它为什么被低估，以及你应不应该玩

Berseria 的 Metacritic 分数是 79-80 分——「总体好评」——但在口碑层面，它从来没有得到应有的位置。部分原因是视觉：游戏的环境设计是真的老旧，地下城沉闷、地图线性，和剧情与战斗的质量完全不在一个水准。如果你冲着 PS5 的视觉体验来，你会失望。

但如果你是为了叙事来的，它是过去十年 JRPG 里执行得最彻底的反英雄故事之一。

没玩过 Tales 系列的 JRPG 玩家：战斗系统需要 20 小时左右才能进入状态，叙事从第一个小时就会钩住你。节奏是慢热但回报丰厚的那种，适合愿意在一款游戏里深度停留的人，不适合喜欢快节奏推进的人。

如果你像我一样，在 Zestiria 上碰壁之后绕开了 Berseria：这两款游戏的游戏感完全不同，别用 Zestiria 的体验来预判这一款。而且 Berseria 是 Zestiria 的 1000 年前传——打完之后再看 Zestiria 的世界观设定，会有完全不同的理解，这是一种额外的回报。

顺带一提——Tales of Berseria Remastered 明天正式发布 (2026 年 2 月 26 日，PS5 / Xbox Series X|S / Switch / PC)，包含品质改善和 DLC 内容包。如果你一直在等一个开始的理由，现在是个很好的时机。
