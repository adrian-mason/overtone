I finished Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana three days ago. I got the platinum. I've done everything there is to do on this island. And I still can't stop thinking about it.

This isn't really a review. Reviews have scores and structured analysis and professional distance. I don't have any of that right now. What I have is this hollow feeling in my chest that opened up the moment the credits rolled, and a desperate urge to talk about a video game with anyone who will listen.

## How I Even Got Here

I picked this up on PS5 mostly on a whim. The screenshots looked gorgeous — lush jungles, ancient ruins, that shimmering coastline — and I'd heard people online call it one of the best JRPGs in years. What I wasn't prepared for was just how completely it would swallow me whole.

The first few hours are almost deceptively simple. You're Adol Christin, a red-haired adventurer who gets shipwrecked (again, apparently this happens to him a lot), washes up on a cursed island, and starts gathering survivors. Build a village. Fight monsters. Explore. Classic stuff.

And then the dreams start.

## Dana

I don't want to say too much about Dana Iclucia for anyone who hasn't played, except: she is the reason this game is a masterpiece.

Adol starts experiencing her memories — this blue-haired girl from an ancient civilization, thousands of years dead. You play as her in the past. You watch her grow up. You watch her lose people she loves. You watch her slowly, quietly realize what she has to do, even though it will cost her everything.

There's this one moment — Dana planting a "wish tree" alone in the middle of a dying world, snow falling around her, no one watching — and then the game cuts to Adol, in the present, standing under that same tree, now ancient and enormous, in full bloom. I had to put the controller down.

It's the kind of storytelling that only games can do. Not because the writing is especially flowery or cinematic, but because *you were there for both sides of it*. You planted that tree. You stood under it. The weight of those thousands of years in between — you feel it in your bones.

## The Combat Is Just... Fun?

I want to say something smart about the battle system but honestly: it just feels *great*.

The Flash Guard, the Flash Move, the three-character party swapping — it's the kind of system that's easy to learn but endlessly satisfying to get good at. On Nightmare difficulty (yes, I did it, yes, it was brutal), timing a perfect Flash Guard in the middle of a boss's combo and watching your entire team go into overdrive is genuinely one of the most satisfying things I've experienced in a game this year.

And on PS5, running at 4K/60fps, everything is just *clean*. The combat looks as good as it feels. Every hit has weight. The screen fills with particle effects and your brain just goes quiet. Good quiet.

## The Island Itself

Can we talk about Seiren Island for a second?

This place is *beautiful*. Not just for a game originally built for the Vita — it's genuinely beautiful, full stop. The way the light hits the Sunshine Coastline at different times of day. The stillness inside the ancient ruins. That terrifying plunge when you first reach the higher elevations and realize how big this place actually is. I spent so much time just standing in spots, rotating the camera, taking it in.

Exploring with the fog of war on the map slowly clearing felt almost meditative. That last 0.1% of map completion I was hunting for before the platinum — I was annoyed at it and also kind of glad it gave me an excuse to keep walking around this place.

## The Platinum, and What Comes After

I've gotten platinums before. Most of the time, the trophy pops and I feel a clean sense of completion — like filing the last document in a folder and closing the drawer.

This wasn't like that.

When "Travelogue of the Gaete Sea" appeared in the corner of my screen, I felt proud for about four seconds. And then that hollow feeling arrived. Because getting the platinum meant I had seen everything. There was nothing left to find on this island. No new survivors to rescue. No corners of the jungle still gray with fog. No more dreams of Dana.

The true ending is stunning and heartbreaking in equal measure. Dana's fate is exactly what it needs to be — right and inevitable and still somehow devastating. She doesn't get to come back. She gets to become something larger than herself, and that's wonderful, and it's also a kind of loneliness I wasn't prepared for at 1am on a Tuesday.

The forums call it "post-game depression." They're not wrong. It's not sadness exactly. It's more like finishing a long conversation with someone you'll never get to talk to again.

## So, What Now?

People keep telling me Ys IX is good, but also that it's different — more urban, different atmosphere, and by most accounts a step down from VIII. Someone else said skip straight to X. I can't really think about any of it yet — Dana's still in my head and Seiren Island hasn't quite faded.

What I have been turning over in my head, though, is something a friend mentioned — a game called ASTLIBRA Revision. One person in Japan developed it solo over fourteen years. It's a 2D side-scrolling ARPG, and apparently the core of it is about time loops and fate and the cost of changing what's already happened. I asked if it was any good. They said: "If you can get past the old-school visuals, the story hits just as hard as Dana's."

That line has been sitting with me. "Just as hard as Dana's" is a bold thing to say. Either it's true or it isn't, and I'm curious enough that I'll probably find out eventually.

But not yet.

For now I'm going to let Seiren Island sit with me a little longer. I'm going to let the *Sunshine Coastline* guitar riff play in my head on the commute. I'm going to think about Dana standing alone in the snow, doing what had to be done, leaving a message in the roots of a tree for someone she'd never meet.

That's what great games do, I think. They give you somewhere real to have been.

I was on that island. I knew those people. I watched Dana become a god.

And I miss it already.

*"The journey of a hundred volumes begins with a single shipwreck." — Adol, probably*

<!-- zh -->

白金通关《伊苏8：丹娜的陨泪》已经三天了。

该探索的地方全探索了，该打的 Boss 全打了，图鉴填满了，委托完成了，奖杯全解锁了。然后我就坐在那里，看着屏幕，感觉胸口空了一块。

这篇文章不是测评。测评有评分，有结构，有那种我现在完全没有的专业距离感。我现在有的，只是想找人聊聊这个游戏的冲动，以及一种说不清楚的、像是失去了什么的感觉。

## 怎么就这么好玩了

说实话，我一开始对这个游戏没有特别高的期待。PS5 版本的截图好看，听说口碑不错，就买来玩了。

头几个小时很「正常」。红发冒险家亚特鲁又一次翻船（这人出海就没有不翻船的），漂到一座孤岛上，开始收留幸存者、建村子、打怪物、探索地图。该有的元素都有，挺好玩，但也就挺好玩。

然后亚特鲁开始做梦。

然后丹娜出现了。

## 丹娜

丹娜·伊克路西亚这个角色，是我这款游戏成为我心中杰作的原因。

通过亚特鲁的梦境，你进入了数千年前一个叫埃塔尼亚的古代文明，操控着一个蓝发少女的一生。她从懵懂、到成长、到失去挚友、到面对整个文明的覆灭——而你，是那个陪着她走完全程的人。

有一幕我印象极深：严冬里，世界正在死去，丹娜一个人在空旷的废墟里种下一棵祈愿树。没有人看着她，没有人陪她，雪花落下来，她只是安静地种树。然后镜头一切，现代，亚特鲁站在同一棵树下——几千年过去了，那棵树已经参天古木，枝叶繁茂。

我把手柄放下来了。

这种叙事是只有游戏才能做到的东西。不是因为台词多漂亮或者 CG 多精致，而是因为你亲手种了那棵树，你也亲眼站在它下面。那几千年的时间跨度，是你自己走出来的。

## 战斗系统，真好耍

说点轻松的。

我知道很多 JRPG 的战斗到后期会变成一种义务，一种「不得不打」的流程。《伊苏8》不是。打到最后，我还是很享受战斗的。

「瞬间格挡」和「瞬间闪避」这两个机制，让战斗有了一种博弈的乐趣——不是单纯的砍砍砍，而是要读攻击、要找节奏。在 Nightmare 难度下，Boss 打出一个连段，你在最后一刻按下 L1 触发闪避，世界慢下来，你单方面输出一波——那种爽感，每一次都不腻。

在 PS5 上跑 4K/60 帧，战斗视觉效果又清又利落。打击感、粒子特效、角色切换的流畅度，加在一起，让人有种「就想一直打」的欲望。

## 塞连岛太好看了

真的好看。

不是那种「考虑到硬件限制还不错」的好看，是真的好看。阳光海岸线（Sunshine Coastline）的光，古代遗迹里的安静，热带丛林里透过树冠洒下来的光斑，越往岛的深处走，风景越让人屏住呼吸。

我在 PS5 上开着 4K 模式，有好多次就站在原地转了一圈相机，什么都没干，就是看。

白金要求地图 100% 探索。追那最后的 0.1% 地图迷雾的时候，我心里有点烦，但也有点庆幸——又多了一个在岛上到处走走的理由。

## 白金之后的那种空

我打过不少白金。通常奖杯弹出来，是一种干净的满足感，像做完一件事打了个勾。

这次不是。

「塞特海旅行志」弹出来的时候，我高兴了大概四秒钟，然后那种空感就来了。

因为白金，意味着我把这座岛的每一寸都走完了。没有新的幸存者等我去找，没有还没揭开的地图迷雾，没有下一个丹娜的梦。

真结局很精彩，也很令人心碎。丹娜的结局是她应得的、也是必然的那种——壮丽，对，但也是一种很深的孤独。她没有回来。她成为了更广大的某种存在，守护着这个世界，独自守护。我在凌晨一点看完这段，有点久久说不出话来。

游戏社区里有个词叫「post-game depression（游戏通关后抑郁）」，我之前觉得有点夸张。这次我懂了。不是真正的悲伤，更像是一段很好的对话结束了，对面的人消失了，你还想继续说。

## 然后呢

有人说伊苏 9 也很好，但风格变了很多，更偏城市感，整体评价不如 8。也有人劝我直接跳到 10。我现在还提不起劲去想这些——脑子里还住着丹娜，塞连岛还没散。

倒是最近有人跟我提了一款叫《神之天平》的游戏——一个日本人独自开发了 14 年的 2D 横版 ARPG，核心叙事也是跟时间跳跃、命运干涉有关，据说通关后同样有很强烈的那种空感。我当时随口问了一句「好玩吗」，对方回我：「你能接受老画风的话，剧情不比丹娜差。」

这句话我记住了。不确定是不是真的，但「不比丹娜差」这种话，随便说说很容易，认真说出来就有点分量了。

可能过一段时间会去试试。但不是现在。

现在我还想先让塞连岛在脑子里再待一会儿。让《Sunshine Coastline》的电吉他在通勤路上再响一响。让丹娜在雪地里种树的那个画面再停一停。

好游戏给你一个真实存在过的地方。

我去过那座岛。我认识那群漂流者。我看着丹娜成为了神明。

我还挺想她的。
